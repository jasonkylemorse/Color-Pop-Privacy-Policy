Privacy Policy
This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on the Color Pop Deluxe applications for iPhone and any other devices and platforms.

Information we collect
We collect no personal, identifying information in our app. The first time you open the app, a unique identifier will be generated and saved on your device. This is used to match your high score (if submitted to the leaderboard) to your device. If you choose to submit your high score, we will store the name you provide, your score, and the date/time the score was achieved. The user agrees to be liable for any names submitted that contain sensitive information. 

Information about your game progress, including high scores and badges, is all stored locally on the device. We also collect anonymous analytics through our game engine, Unity. 

Technical basics
We only collect information about your game progress, and this data is stored locally on your device. If the user chooses to submit their high score, the name they submit, their score, the date/time achieved, and a unique identifier will be stored in AWS. 

Ads and analytics
Color Pop Deluxe collects anonymous statistics to improve the app.

All advertisement delivery and interaction is managed via the Unity game engine, and Color Pop Deluxe neither collects, nor retains any of it. 

Information usage
We use the analytics information to operate and improve our app.

We do not share personal information with outside parties.

We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.

In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.

Security
The application runs locally and only sends analytics information to Unity. Any score the user submits is stored in AWS with their provided name, date/time achieved, and unique identifier. 

Third-party links and content
Color Pop Deluxe displays advertisements from third-party organizations. These have their own independent privacy policies, and we have no responsibility or liability for their content or activities.

California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance
We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.

Information for European Union Customers
By using Color Pop Deluxe and providing your information, you authorize us to collect, use, and store your information outside of the European Union.

International Transfers of Information
Information may be processed, stored, and used outside of the country in which you are located. Data privacy laws vary across jurisdictions, and different laws may be applicable to your data depending on where it is processed, stored, or used.

Your Consent
By using our application, you consent to our privacy policy.
