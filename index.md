Privacy Policy
This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on the Color Pop Deluxe applications for iPhone and any other devices and platforms.

Information we collect
We collect no personal information in our app. 

Information about your game progress, including high scores and badges, is all stored locally on the device. We also collect anonymous analytics through our game engine, Unity. 

Technical basics
We only collect information about your game progress, and this data is stored locally on your device. 

Ads and analytics
Color Pop Deluxe collects anonymous statistics to improve the app.

All advertisement delivery and interaction is managed via the Unity game engine, and Color Pop Deluxe neither collects, nor retains any of it. 

Information usage
We use the analytics information to operate and improve our app.

We do not share personal information with outside parties.

We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.

In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.

Security
The application runs locally and only sends analytics information to Unity.

Third-party links and content
Color Pop Deluxe displays advertisements from third-party organizations. These have their own independent privacy policies, and we have no responsibility or liability for their content or activities.
